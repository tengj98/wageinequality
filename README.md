# How wage growth has stagnated for the working class

Rising wages typically mean a stronger economy. But the pandemic skewered that measure. This project utilizes D3.js + scrollytelling to illustrate how wage growth has stagnated over time.

The repo also includes wage data from the [Economic Policy Institute](https://www.epi.org/publication/swa-wages-2021/).
