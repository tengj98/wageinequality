			<br>
			<p class="intro__dek">
				Rising wages typically mean a stronger economy. But the pandemic skewered that measure. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>In April 2020 — when the U.S hemorrhaged a colossal 21 million jobs — average hourly earnings skyrocketed 8% year-over-year, the highest level since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began recording the data in 2006. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>The pay growth amid the pandemic, however, was an anomaly due to drastic changes in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/04/19/the-pandemics-effect-on-measured-wage-growth/" target="_blank">workforce composition</a>. Millions of low-paid workers were laid off, while the highest paid retained their jobs — driving the average up. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>In reality, data from the <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/swa-wages-2021/" target="_blank">Economic Policy Institute</a> shows that salary growth for lower-income workers has stagnated, especially over the past four decades. Instead, wage increases are lining the pockets of the best-paid, rather than being distributed across the workforce: Between 1979 and 2020, the top 1% of earners saw wages burgeon by 179%, while those in the bottom 90% saw pay grow an anemic 28%.

					<p>In the past seven decades, average wages earned by workers in the <span style="color: #E2B640">bottom 90%</span> roughly grew by 141% to $40,085.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="2">
					<p>By comparison, those in the <span style="color: #5DD462">top 5%</span> saw average salaries more than quadruple to about $340,000.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="step" data-step="3">
					<p>These increases pale in comparison to the pay jump for the <span style="color: #82C5E6">top 1%</span> of earners, who saw average salaries grow eightfold to $3.2 million.</p>

				Ultimately, <a href="https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/" target="_blank">the Economic Policy Institute argues</a> that the disparity is due to the steady dismantling of policy bulwarks protecting workers since the 70s, including lower tax rates for the richest, “right to work” laws that make it more difficult to unionize, failure to raise the federal minimum wage, and industry deregulation.

				The decades-long campaign to disempower the vast majority of America’s workers was not waged in one fell swoop. Instead, policymakers closely aligned with corporate interests have consistently promoted a systematic, wide-ranging agenda to shift economic leverage away from typical workers and households, and only an equally deliberate and expansive set of policies will shift it back.” — The Economic Policy Institute's <a href="https://www.epi.org/policy/" target="_blank">Policy Agenda</a>
